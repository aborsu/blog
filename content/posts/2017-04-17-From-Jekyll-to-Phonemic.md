Wanting to add interactivity to my landing page, there was no cutting it. I had to learn JavaScript. While compiling to JavaScript from other languages is possible and ScalaJs is pretty mature, this would destroy two goals that I wanted to keep. Keep the websites' footprint as small as possible and be accessible to people who turn off JavaScript. Considering these requirements, I was drawn to two projects, [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) and [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), who both offer static website generation using from markdown using react components.

Phenomic promised a slightly smaller footprint than Gatsby and therefore I chose to try it first. Converting my old blog took less than an hour. Styling took a bit more than 4 hours (not my strong point) and integrating Eliza (the whole point of switching to JavaScript) took roughly two hours.

So all in all, I would say Success!
